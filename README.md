# DiscordModeratorBot

Minecraft version: 1.20.1

An extension for the Minecraft Server Plugin EssentialsDiscord that allows members with specific roles (Moderators) to retrieve Information  about a users linked Discord/Minecraft account for Moderation purposes outside of the chat/console channel.

I wrote this plugin for private use for our discord server, but figured the code should be public, should something happen.
